            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Boluwatife Oyebajo — an undergraduate with a passion for technology, design, and
                innovation. I run Rayolink, a web design agency, where I help brands bring their ideas to life with
                clean, modern, and user-friendly websites. Beyond design, I’m also building PlayWall, a Web3 mobile
                gaming and gambling platform, blending creativity with cutting-edge technology.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p> In my free time, I like playing video games, exploring new tech ideas, and working on small design
                projects. I also enjoy listening to music (mostly Afrobeats and lo-fi), reading a bit of sci-fi, and
                going on walks when I need to clear my head.</p>

            <h2>Aspirations in Life</h2>
            <p> I aspire to build a career that blends technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship. My long-term goal
                is to grow my web design agency into a recognized brand that helps businesses establish strong digital
                identities. Beyond that, I want to create innovative projects like PlayWall, using Web3 and blockchain
                to shape how people interact with gaming and digital platforms.

                On a personal level, I hope to keep learning, improving my skills, and building opportunities not only
                for myself but also for others around me. Ultimately, I want to create something lasting — whether it’s
                a company, a product, or an idea — that makes a real impact.</p>
